# Dependify

**Code Smarter, Not Harder.**

Dependify is an AI-powered developer tool that automates code maintenance, slashes technical debt, and frees up developers to focus on innovation. Stop wrestling with legacy code and let Dependify bring your projects into the future.

## 🔥 The Problem: Drowning in Technical Debt

The numbers don't lie:
- **41% of developers** spend most of their time dealing with technical debt
- Developers dedicate **16.4 hours per week** to maintenance tasks like debugging and refactoring
- This constant struggle with complex, outdated code is a major contributor to **developer burnout**

Sound familiar? You're not alone.

## 💡 The Dependify Solution: AI-Powered Code Revitalization

Dependify leverages the power of Generative AI to automate the tedious and time-consuming aspects of code maintenance. By intelligently scanning your codebase, refactoring code, updating dependencies, and generating clear comments, Dependify transforms your maintenance backlog into a streamlined, automated workflow.

**The result?** Improved code quality, reduced technical debt, and developers who can focus on what they do best: innovate and build great software.

## 🏆 Proven Impact: Real Results

Dependify isn't just a concept—it's a tool that delivers tangible results. We successfully improved code quality by auto-updating all major outdated dependencies in **Microsoft's Magma repository**, leading to a **merged pull request (PR #63)**. This achievement demonstrates Dependify's capability to produce production-ready code improvements for significant open-source projects.
